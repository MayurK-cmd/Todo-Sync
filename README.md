Backend --



🚀 **New Project!** 🚀

I’ve integrated user management and todo functionalities into my backend app! 🎉 Users can now:

- **Sign Up** 🔐
- **Login** 🔑
- **Delete Account** ❌

Plus, they can:

- **Create** 📝
- **Update** ✏️
- **View All** 👀
- **Mark as Completed** ✅
- **Delete** 🗑️

The backend is crafted with **JavaScript**, **Zod**, and **Mongoose**. 💻 Tested thoroughly with **MongoDB Compass** and **Postman**. 🔧🔍 User accounts are secured with **JSON Web Tokens** (JWT). 🔒

Stay tuned for the frontend! 😎

📅 Add extra functionality with optional reminders, labels, and even attach images to your tasks! 
✅ Effortlessly mark todos as completed and keep track of your progress.

This is just the beginning—more exciting features are on the way! Stay tuned for updates! 🔥
